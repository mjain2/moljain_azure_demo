A basic web application that uses the Azure SQL Database and Visual Studio to create a dynamic contact list. 

The main page is the standard Web API page created with Visual Studio 2015.  Click on 'Find Contacts' to go to the sample page. Here, you can view the existing contacts in the database and search by complete alias or search in general terms for Name, Alias, Team or Hobbies. 

The Web App is hosted on the Azure portal. The SQL db of contacts is also hosted on the Azure portal. Used C#, Javascript, HTML to create Web App (on Visual Studio) in a Web API Entity Framework.  

This was created to gain familiarity with Visual Studio and the Azure Cloud Portal.
